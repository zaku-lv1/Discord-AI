# Discord AI Bot - Refactoring Changes

## 🔄 Major Refactoring (January 2025)

This project has been completely refactored to address code quality issues and improve maintainability. The functionality remains exactly the same, but the codebase is now much cleaner and easier to work with.

### ✅ Issues Fixed

- **Fixed recursive function bug**: The `getServerTimestamp()` function was calling itself recursively, causing stack overflow
- **Removed duplicate route definitions**: Multiple `/api/settings/toka` routes were defined
- **Improved error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling middleware
- **Separated concerns**: Split monolithic file into focused modules

### 🏗️ New Architecture

The application is now organized into clear, maintainable modules:

```
├── server.js                 # Main server entry point
├── services/
│   ├── firebase.js          # Firebase service with proper initialization
│   └── auth.js              # Discord OAuth and authentication service
├── middleware/
│   └── auth.js              # Authentication and error handling middleware
├── routes/
│   ├── auth.js              # Authentication routes (/auth/*)
│   ├── ai.js                # AI management routes (/api/ais/*)
│   ├── settings.js          # Settings routes (/api/settings/*)
│   └── user.js              # User management routes (/api/update-*)
├── bot/
│   └── discord-bot.js       # Discord bot logic separated from web server
└── commands/                # Discord slash commands (unchanged)
```

### 🚀 Benefits

1. **Better Error Handling**: Proper error middleware catches and handles errors gracefully
2. **Easier Debugging**: Separated concerns make it easier to locate and fix issues
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
4. **Better Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
5. **Cleaner Code**: Removed duplicate code and fixed architectural issues

### 📝 Migration Notes

- **Entry Point**: Changed from `index.js` to `server.js`
- **Backward Compatibility**: The old `index.js` is preserved as `index.js.backup`
- **Environment Variables**: All environment variables remain the same
- **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints work exactly as before
- **Discord Commands**: All Discord bot commands remain unchanged

### 🧪 Testing

A test script is included to verify all functionality:

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# In another terminal, run tests
node test_server.js
```

### 🔄 Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the refactored server
- `npm run start:old` - Start the old server (backup)
- `npm run dev` - Development mode (same as start)

The refactoring maintains 100% feature parity while significantly improving code quality and maintainability.
